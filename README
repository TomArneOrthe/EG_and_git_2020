About this Example
-------------------------
The purpose of this example is to show how you can use modern source
control management tools to manage your SAS work in SAS Enterprise Guide.

This is possible through the use of the file system integration that most
source control tools now offer.  For example, with CVS and Subversion you can use
TortoiseCVS or TortoiseSVN to manage your local "playpen" of content.  With git, you can 
use the github Tools for Windows.

What this example contains
----------------------------
This example contains two versions of a SAS-based analysis project:
* NetflixProject43.egp (for use with SAS Enterprise Guide 4.3)
* NetflixProject51.egp (for use with SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1)

Each of these projects reference the same set of external "assets", which
are stored in subfolders relative to the EGP files:
* ./data/NetflixHistory.xlsx  (one input data source)
* ./data/NetflixInstantWatch.xlsx (another input data source)
* ./programs/*.sas (several SAS programs used in the projects)

In addition to managing your files locally, you must tell SAS Enterprise Guide
about the important content that is stored in *relative* paths along with the
project file (EGP file).

This setting is maintained per project.  To set it:

1. Select File->Project Properties.  The Properties window appears.
2. Select the File References tab.
3. Check the box: "Use paths relative to the project for programs and importable files"

With this selected, you can now store .SAS program files and "importable" data files 
(such as Excel, CSV, or Microsoft Access MDB files) in the same path with the EGP file *or* in a 
subfolder of that path.  You can then copy the entire directory structure to any other
location, and SAS Enterprise Guide will still be able to find and use those files.

By removing the dependency on absolute paths for these resources, you can more easily share
projects and their contents with colleagues.  You can maintain different versions of the 
external "assets" (such as programs) by taking advantage of the features of the
source control management tool.
